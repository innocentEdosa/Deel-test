# Getting Started with Autocomplete application


Hello, Hope you are good?

I must state that this implementation was greatly rushed as I was trying to meet the 75 minutes deadline. To make the project production ready, I would debounce Input change handler, and also fix issues with onblur and on select click events.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
